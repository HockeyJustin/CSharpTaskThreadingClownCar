# C# Task<T> Playing with threading to make a clown car.

Created it a while back for a 'Lunch and Learn' and thought I'd put it online for people to look at/ play with.

For more info on Tasks, see the [docs folder](https://github.com/HockeyJustin/CSharpTaskThreadingClownCar/tree/master/ThreadingDevWeek/Docs/Threading%20Presentation).

Requires VS2015+.
